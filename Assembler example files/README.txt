Example files need the following plugins:

. Assembler (of course) - version 1.0.9 - files won't work with newer versions
. Elefront
. froGH
. Human

They can all be installed via the Rhino Package Manager:

. Rhino 7: type PackageManager in the command line and search for the plugins names to install them

. Rhino 6: type TestPackageManager in the command line (type it in full, there is no autocomplete for it) and search for the plugins names to install them
